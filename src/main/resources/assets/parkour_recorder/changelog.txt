§2§l§nMajor Update v1.1.0.0 - Tabular Menu GUI
  §e§lAdded Features
    §7§l-Front-end Rework:§r The 'widgets' used in Gui's work independently from MC with the goal of porting into other MC versions quicker and easier.
    §7§l-Tabular Menu Gui:§r Three pages in one Gui screen (Load, Save, Timeline). Each page can be loaded by clicking their respective tabs.
    §7§l-Timeline Controls:§r Use controls similar to YouTube to operate the timeline (space bar, J, K, L).

  §c§lBug Fixes
    -Renaming a recording in the Load page doesn't rename the recording.
    -Overriding a recording in the Save page improperly renames the file.
    -Crashing and rendering bugs on other PCs. Thus GLSL shaders won't be used until I figure out how to use them properly.
